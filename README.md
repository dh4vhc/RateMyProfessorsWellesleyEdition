# RateMyProfessorsWellesleyEdition

Check out my project from HackDartmouth 2021 at https://github.com/amandakcheung/RateMyProfessorsWellesleyEdition!

We worked with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java to create a website that implemented a backend server. We used a spring framework to grab inputs from users on the front-end and process it into a database where the different inputs would be collected.
